    <h4>New blog coming along, 20.08.2021 11:00</h4>
    <p>My idea to rework the current blog backend has long given way to a completely new blog software. It is still written in Python. This time, however, there will be full markdown support (which I have already implemented!), support for archive stuff (so that the main page does not fill up too much), all while remaining a static website. When I first wrote down the specs of the site I wanted to create, I figured it would take me one full day of work. I think that this estimate was and still remains pretty accurate, the task has been stretched over several days because I simply haven't gotten to spend a full day coding. Although it would be fun (: I am also delaying the deployment because I am checking out new programming patterns I have wanted to try out for a long time. In particular, I am enjoying the liberal use of map() and reduce(). Additionally, I have written a number of tests, which were not very necessary at all, since the scope of the project remains small and exploratory manual testing would have been perfectly fine by itself. But you know, in German there's the saying "wer kann, der kann" -- "who can do, can do" (I am not a good translator at all, pls don't hate me for this). Applied to my situation, it means that I have the skill, the time and the interest in doing all the things I am doing, and hence I am also doing them. </p>

    <h4>Doing different things, the meaning of proficiency?, 14.07.2021 00:00</h4>
    <p>I have been busy doing a variety of things, hence the blog hasn't been updated in forever. But I intend to write some more now and do so in a more regular fashion. As I am writing this, I am truly noticing the dire lack of Markdown-support by my trashy blog implementation thingy. It should be up next on my todo-list of fun little coding projects. Maybe I should even make a video about it. On the topic of videos, I plan to make a series of Mathematica tutorials. Nothing too in-depth, nothing too serious, just a bunch of short tips and tricks. Because, as I have noticed once more just this morning (as I was working on some homework involving matrices), I can do some pretty neat stuff with Mathematica at this point, and I have achieved a decent speed. What's more, I even wrote some of the code while sharing my screen with my homework buddy. He watched me code. And it worked. I'd love to have italics support, because then I would properly highlight the ~he watched me code~ part. Because that's crazy. Usually I just blank out and fail epically when I code for an audience, be it a larger crowd or just one dude. Maybe this is proficiency? </p>

    <h4>Coding Weekend, 23.05.2021 00:00</h4>
    <p>I wrote some fun code over the weekend, and I feel like I should disclose it here. I actually managed to continue working on the actual Scream project, and that actually tuned out to be really fun. I finished the "Start" components, which mainly cover authentification, so I will soon hop over to the "Main" component. Choosing to use Blueprints has proven to be confusing but I am slowly wrapping my head around the concept and might soon begin to appreciate their use. The site hasn't been pushed yet and is extremely ugly, owing to the complete lack of CSS, which I intend to change soon. Nothing fancy, but some flex displays, justified content and margins might just do the trick (colours and actual nice design aren't my thing -- a website should retain the charm and effectivity of plain HTML without actually hindering you in what you want to do). More on that later, when I get to doing it properly. I wrote unit tests for the entire system, and they seem to be working fine. I am enjoying the process of writing these tests a heck of a lot. It satisfies me to see that they all passed. As I am writing this, I am fully aware of the fact that one of these tests will always pass, but I will change this illogical behaviour soon. I need to expand the tests and also find some way to check for test coverage, whatever that might be (but it keeps popping up when you read about unit tests). I am sticking to the unittests package instead of moving over to pytest, which seems to have a lot of benefits, but I have already begun with unittest and this package has a reputation of being easier on beginners. It is great to see how I am improving my web development game in tiny but noticeable steps. When I compare what I have now to my previous site, I am quite pleased. While many things there went okay, I learnt a lot out of the things I did badly and made a real effort to not repeat the same mistakes. In particular, I have a much better code structure, I have tests, I understand the whole shebang under the hood ("understand" is a relative term, but whatever) (with "under the hood" I mean systemctl, nginx, the wsgi interface, the like). The entire thing just looks, feels and seems better. Which is great, because it happened that way by design (: I had a lot of fun with that. Moving forward, I intend to write the "Main" part, I am especially excited to learn about AJAX (which I intend to use atm, but I haven't done a lot of research yet). I have plans for the blog software too, I want the make the individual blog items linkeable (not sure if the effort is really worth it though), at the very least I want to sort by month. I am not hitting problems of scale yet (nor will I anytime soon, at the rate at which I am outputting blogposts), but I like being prepared, and most I especially like the process of getting prepared, since it involves de-stressing with some nice uncommented and buggy Python-code xd </p>

    <h4>Rewriting, 05.05.2021 00:00</h4>
    <p>I rewrote the blog script. I have never written a blog script before
so it came as no surprise that my first attempt would be absolute
crap. I believe that my second attempt has a less organic and more
streamlined design. It also implements a number of things that I have
noticed to be lacking in my current version. It isn't deployed yet.
I need to make sure that the current posts are somehow preserved,
but I don't quite know how to correctly transfer them into the new
format (I mean I have an idea how to do it but I don't think it will
be quick so maybe I will just go with a
quick-and-dirty-and-less-than-perfect method). My newest version lacks
tests and comments, which shall follow soon (my old version also lacks
tests and comments, but those will never follow).</p>

    <h4>Oh yes, 04.05.2021 00:00</h4>
    <p>Because the file creation date is relevant (or at least that is how I
explain it to myself) the post is indeed dated to the 03.05., keeping
up the habit of a daily post. Although this is my second one today and
I will probably write another meaningless pile of text later.</p>
